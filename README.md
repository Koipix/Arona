<center><b>Complete and configurable currency and games multipurpose Discord bot</b></center>

**Inspired by [Mantaro](https://github.com/Mantaro)**

## Building the Bot

### Prerequisite:

You will need the following to utilize all of Arona's features when building your own instance:
* MongoDB, at least version 6
* Node.js, at least 2.0+
* Giphy Web API for action commands

**It's still in progress, so newer frameworks and api might be used in the future.**
